# SQL-creditcard-fraud_detection
#### This project involves SQL-based analysis on a credit card fraud detection dataset. It includes calculating basic statistics, exploring class distribution (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions), and analyzing transaction patterns by time of day. The project also investigates anomalies using the 3-sigma rule, examines correlations between various features, and compares the characteristics of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Additionally, it features grouping transactions based on features, analyzing fraud percentages over time, and identifying common transaction amounts in fraudulent cases.
